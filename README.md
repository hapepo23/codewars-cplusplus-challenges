### A word of warning

**If you really want to learn C++ and improve through the challenges, don't just copy my solutions. You won't learn anything that way!**

-----

My solutions to some [**Codewars challenges**](https://www.codewars.com/users/briskwalker), programmed in **C++**, might not be the most sophisticated, but at least mostly easy to read and understand. However, a few are implemented rather poorly, as I am still a beginner.

### !! Security Notice !! 

The code I released here into the public domain may appear in third-party projects. I do not maintain, endorse, or have any affiliation with such projects. Any malicious or deceptive use is unauthorized and should be reported to the hosting platform. 

My published Codewars solutions in this repository have been copied and misused in other GitHub repositories as a kind of honeypot to trick users into downloading malicious software. So please be careful! I have reported this to GitHub, but unfortunately, GitHub remains inactive and has not removed this type of abuse until now.
